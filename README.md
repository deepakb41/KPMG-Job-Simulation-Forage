# KPMG Data Analytics Virtual Internship - Forage

This repository contains the work I completed as part of the KPMG AU Data Analytics Virtual Internship on Forage. This program is designed to provide insights into what a career in data analytics at KPMG would be like.

## Project Overview

The project involved conducting detailed data analysis for Sprocket Central Pty Ltd, a fictitious organization specializing in high-quality bikes and cycling accessories. The datasets provided contained information about customers' demographics, transactions, and addresses. My task was to assess the data quality, prepare the datasets for analysis, derive actionable insights, and identify high-value customers from a new customer dataset.

## Repository Structure

This repository includes the following files and folders:

- `Data/`: This folder contains the raw datasets.
- `Sprocket_Central_Customer_Insights.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with the full analysis, including data cleaning, exploration, and visualization.
- `Sprocket Central Analysis.twb`: Tableau workbook with interactive dashboards showcasing the insights derived from the analysis.
